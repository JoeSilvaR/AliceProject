# Alice Project

## Goal
The goal of the Alice Project is to create a simulated model of human consciousness and cognition. It aims to encapsulate the complexities of human thought processes, emotions, decision-making, and learning within a computer-based model.

## Intent
The intent is to develop a system that can:
1. Understand and perform tasks at varying levels of complexity (e.g., reading, data analysis).
2. Learn from its experiences and improve its performance on tasks.
3. Generate unique expressions or questions based on its experiences and learning.
4. Simulate emotional states like pleasure and pain based on the tasks it performs.
5. Allow for scalability and multimodal inputs in the future.

## Outline
The project is structured into different versions of Alice, each building upon the previous, adding layers of complexity and capabilities:
1. `BasicAlice`: A basic implementation focusing on task execution and emotional states.
2. `AdvancedAlice`: Introduces a machine learning model to predict the effectiveness of questions it might ask.
3. `UniqueExpressionAlice`: Adds the ability for Alice to express unique thoughts and questions.
4. `FullyIntegratedAlice`: A fully-integrated version that brings all the above elements together.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
- Natural Language Processing

## Future Directions
- Integrate deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms for better learning and decision-making.
- Add a user-feedback loop for continuous improvement.
- Allow Alice to interact with the real-world data and environments.
